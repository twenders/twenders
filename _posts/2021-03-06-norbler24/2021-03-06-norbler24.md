# Part I

It started with this introducing message:

<a  href="part1/first.jpg"><img src="part1/first.jpg" width="200"/></a>

which led to Nora looking under her chair (see [SOLUTION](part1-solns/soln_first.jpg)), and finding the second bit, a ballet music recognition quiz, involving the following slip of paper, and a thumb-drive with three tunes on it

<a  href="part1/ballet-tunes1.jpg"><img src="part1/ballet-tunes1.jpg" width="200"/></a>
<a  href="part1/ballet-tunes.jpg"><img src="part1/ballet-tunes.jpg" width="200"/></a>

- [tune 1](part1/ballet-music/Ballet1.m4a)
- [tune 2](part1/ballet-music/Ballet2.m4a)
- [tune 3](part1/ballet-music/Ballet3.m4a)

this led to doing some yoga, and finding the next puzzle (Part II, below), taped to the bottom of a shelf (see [ballet tunes SOLUTION](part1-solns/soln_ballet-tunes.jpg)).  

# Part II

a conundrum devised by jacob, involving two slips of paper: 

- 1: a table

<a  href="part2/at-youll-find.jpg"><img src="part2/at-youll-find.jpg" width="200"/></a>

[SOLUTION to the table here](part2-solns/soln_at-youll-find.jpg)

- 2: a map, with 'next step' on the back

<a  href="part2/map.jpg"><img src="part2/map.jpg" width="200"/></a>
<a  href="part2/next-step.jpg"><img src="part2/next-step.jpg" width="200"/></a>

After traipsing around the neighborhood, looking in all the "Little Free Libraries", this puzzle led to filling out the message on the back of the map, as:

> FOR **HELP WITH PUZZLE DECIPHERING**
> 
> **INSERT** "THE ICE CREAM DANCE"
> 

giving the solution, a link to this website, at the unindexed page: [twenders.netlify.app/theIceCreamDance](twenders.netlify.app/theIceCreamDance)    

which led to the prize, hidden in a rain hat, hung on a hook: a pair of socks which Katie had finished knitting just earlier in the evening.
