# 1 a cryptic note

It started with a ciphered note at dinner, devised by Ian:

<a  href="start.jpg"><img src="start.jpg" width="200"/></a>
--->
<a  href="start-soln.jpg"><img src="start-soln.jpg" width="200"/></a>

this led us to the studio theater...

# 2 Washer and dryer

The next component was an ingenious build-it-yourself washer and dryer kit, by Aliza and John,

<a  href="laundry.jpg"><img src="laundry.jpg" width="200"/></a>

Which we marvelled at, [as we compiled it](laundry-solving.jpg).  There was a message inside,

<a  href="laundry0.jpg"><img src="laundry0.jpg" width="200"/></a>,
<a  href="laundry1.jpg"><img src="laundry1.jpg" width="200"/></a>

reading `DRYER`.  (and also, the message `1 is random`)

# 3 Greenest While

This clue was a lovely thing, printed on Zoe's mother's printing press in Viroqua, whence Zev had just returned


<a  href="zev.jpg"><img src="zev.jpg" width="200"/></a>
--->
<a  href="zev-soln.jpg"><img src="zev-soln.jpg" width="200"/></a>

leading to `steering wheel`  (and also, the message `1 is false`)
# 4 A Walk in Jacob's Shoes

A multi-part puzzle, crafted by Katie, 

<a  href="katie.jpg"><img src="katie.jpg" width="200"/></a>

leading one around Montreal in a pattern which spelt out part of the answer

<a  href="katie1.jpg"><img src="katie1.jpg" width="200"/></a>
<a  href="katie2.jpg"><img src="katie2.jpg" width="200"/></a>

the rest coming from some other clues

<a  href="katie3.jpg"><img src="katie3.jpg" width="200"/></a>
<a  href="katie4.jpg"><img src="katie4.jpg" width="200"/></a>
<a  href="katie5.jpg"><img src="katie5.jpg" width="200"/></a>

In the end this led to the answer:

<a  href="katie-soln.jpg"><img src="katie-soln.jpg" width="200"/></a>

`cellphone tower`, with the additional information `1 is true`


# 5 At the cellphone tower

At the cellphone tower, in the dark, we found [some things that we thought were clues, but werent](zev-false-clue.jpg), but the thing we were looking for was an envelope, unlabeled, pinned to a tree.

<a  href="zev-envelope.jpg"><img src="zev-envelope.jpg" width="200"/></a>

# 6 Oracles

A message leading to the final part (by Ian)

<a  href="ian.jpg"><img src="ian.jpg" width="200"/></a>

Heading to the studio, we found **the oracles** 

<a  href="oracles.jpg"><img src="oracles.jpg" width="200"/></a>

their three individual natures being, of course

- one tells the truth  (`1 is true`, from Katie's puzzle)
- one tells the opposite of the truth (`1 is false`, from Zev's puzzle)
- one is random (`1 is random`, from Aliza and John's puzzle)

They explained that we could only ask two questions.

It took us a few hours to find the solution, but we found it in the end, and Jacob opened the package of triumph, which contained an iPhone, a present from Zev.
