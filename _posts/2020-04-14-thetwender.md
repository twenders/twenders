Puzzle begins at [The Beginnings](https://thetwender.wordpress.com/the-beginnings/), and the passwords begin to become clear!
    <details><summary>Solution</summary>
      No password required.
      Begins with Jacob and Katie's puzzle, a three-page letter/story related to noses and bagels as written by a dog. Images of Zev have text overlaid with letters missing. The text also leads to the Quotations page, in which the quotes related to bagels or noses provide letters to the password.

Password protected pages:
- [**About Us**](https://thetwender.wordpress.com/about-us/):
  <details><summary>Solution</summary>
    Password <code>About Us</code>.
    Leads to Aliza and John's puzzle, <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Wqk3sNVY8RTRLGo3k5S2_m-68sf6sTZoeYYF_a1ww3g/edit">Bagel Journey</a> a text-based adventure game implemented in Google Sheets. 
  </details>
- [**Mission Statement**](https://thetwender.wordpress.com/mission-statement/)
  <details><summary>Solution</summary>
    Password <code>MISSION ACCEPTED</code>.
    Leads to Ian and Jasmine's puzzle, a page of Lorem Ipsum where individual letters colored slightly differently. Decoding the hex codes of each color in ascii, thinking of each hex code as three two-digit groups, resulted in the password. Includes snarky Easter Egg if you look at the source code.
  </details>
- [**Apply**](https://thetwender.wordpress.com/apply/)
   <details><summary>Solution</summary>
    Password <code>Apply yourself</code>.
    Leads to Zoe's two-stanza limerick, where a majority of letters were scrambled and color coded. The top of the page indicates a key, where you use the previous three passwords to determine the color coding system of shifting letters left/right/up/down on the keyboard. The bolded word at the end is the password for the final page.
  </details>
- [**Links**](https://thetwender.wordpress.com/links/)
   <details><summary>Solution</summary>
    Password <code>BHooveZ</code>.
    Leads to the final page, which is an image of a letter of recommendation for Zev, from Zoe (certified judge of character).
