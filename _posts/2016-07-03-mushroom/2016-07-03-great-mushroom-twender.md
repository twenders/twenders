Not much is remembered about this twender... except:

- It happened on July 3 2016, for Aliza

- We [traipsed through the field](en_route.jpg) along the way

- There was a clue hidden as a message in a bottle, which [Yinky waded out](yink_wading.jpg) to retrieve

- It ended in the ceiling space above the mudroom, with a pedestal bathed in purple light displaying this MacGuffin pin:
