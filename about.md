Twendering, it's a glorious pastime.  
Maybe we will enjoy looking back on it later...

To help us save twenders past, I've started a repository at [github.com/twenders/](https://github.com/twenders/twenders).  This is structured so it will make a browsable archive [here](/). Might be nice.
If you want to add/edit something, you can send it to the email address below, which is also the login/contact email for the GitHub account.  

Anyone else who wants to edit the archive, or use the email address, I hope Jacob told you the password, because he probably doesn't remember it.
