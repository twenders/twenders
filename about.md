Twendering, it's a glorious pastime.

To help us save twenders past, I've started a repository at [github.com/twenders/](https://github.com/twenders/twenders).  This is structured so it will make a browsable archive, hoster [here](https://twenders.netlify.app), where you are most likely reading this very text.

If you want to add/edit something, you can send it to the email address _the first word of this about message_ at gmail, which is also the login/contact email for the GitHub account.  If you'd like to edit the archive, or use the email address, I hope Jacob told you the password, because he probably doesn't remember it.
